Changelog
=========

For full details see the [releases page](https://mailu.io/1.9/releases.html)

Upgrade should run fine as long as you generate a new compose or stack configuration and upgrade your mailu.env. Please note that once you have upgraded to 1.9 you won't be able to roll-back to earlier versions without resetting user passwords.

If you use a reverse proxy in front of Mailu, it is vital to configure the newly introduced env variables REAL_IP_HEADER and REAL_IP_FROM.
These settings tell Mailu that the HTTP header with the remote client IP address from the reverse proxy can be trusted.
For more information see the [configuration reference](https://mailu.io/1.9/configuration.html#advanced-settings).

One major change for the docker compose file is that the antispam container needs a fixed hostname [#1837](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1837).
This is handled when you regenerate the docker-compose file. A fixed hostname is required to retain rspamd history. 

After changing mailu.env, it is required to recreate all containers for the changes to be propagated.

Please note that the shipped image for PostgreSQL database is fully deprecated now. To migrate to the official PostgreSQL image, you can follow our guide [here](https://mailu.io/master/database.html#mailu-postgresql)

1.9.0 - 2021-12-28
- Features: Document how to setup client autoconfig using an override ([#224](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/224))
- Features: Add support for timezones ([#1154](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1154))
- Features: Ensure that RCVD_NO_TLS_LAST doesn't add to the spam score (as TLS usage can't be determined) ([#1705](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1705))
- Features: Add support for ECDSA certificates when letsencrypt is used. This means dropping compatibility for android < 4.1.1
  Add LETSENCRYPT_SHORTCHAIN to your configuration to avoid sending ISRG Root X1 (this will break compatibility with android < 7.1.1)
  Disable AUTH command on port 25
  Disable TLS tickets, reconfigure the cache to improve Forward Secrecy
  Prevent clear-text credentials from being sent to relays ([#1922](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1922))
- Features: Improved the SSO page. Warning! The new endpoints /sso and /static are introduced.
  These endpoints are now used for handling sign on requests and shared static files.
  You may want to update your reverse proxy to proxy /sso and /static to Mailu (to the front service).
  The example section of using a reverse proxy is updated with this information.
   - New SSO page is used for logging in Admin or Webmail.
   - Made SSO page available separately. SSO page can now be used without Admin accessible (ADMIN=false).
   - Introduced stub /static which is used by all sites for accessing static files.
   - Removed the /admin/ prefix to reduce complexity of routing with Mailu. Admin is accessible directly via /admin instead of /admin/ui
  Note: Failed logon attempts are logged in the logs of admin. You can watch this with fail2ban. ([#1929](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1929))
- Features: Make unbound work with ipv6
  Add a cache-min-ttl of 5minutes
  Enable qname minimisation (privacy) ([#1992](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1992))
- Features: Disable the login page if SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is incompatible with how Mailu is accessed as this seems to be a common misconfiguration. ([#1996](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1996))
- Features: Derive a new subkey (from SECRET_KEY) for SRS ([#2002](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2002))
- Features: allow sending emails as user+detail@domain.tld ([#2007](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2007))
- Features: rspamd: get dkim keys via REST API instead of filesystem ([#2017](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2017))
- Features: updated roundcube to 1.5 and carddav to 4.2.2 using php8 ([#2035](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2035))
- Features: use dovecot-fts-xapian from alpine package ([#2072](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2072))
- Features: Make the rate limit apply to a subnet rather than a specific IP (/24 for v4 and /56 for v6) ([#116](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/116))
- Features: Add instructions on how to create DNS records for email client auto-configuration (RFC6186 style) ([#224](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/224))
- Features: Remove the Received header with PRIMARY_HOSTNAME [PUBLIC_IP] ([#466](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/466))
- Features: Centralize the authentication of webmails behind the admin interface ([#783](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/783))
- Features: Add sending quotas per user ([#1031](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1031))
- Features: Allow specific users to send emails from any address using the WILDCARD_SENDERS setting ([#1096](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1096))
- Features: Use semantic versioning for building releases.
  - Add versioning (tagging) for branch x.y (1.8). E.g. 1.8.0, 1.8.1 etc.
    - docker repo will contain x.y (latest) and x.y.z (pinned version) images.
    - The X.Y.Z tag is incremented automatically. E.g. if 1.8.0 already exists, then the next merge on 1.8 will result in the new tag 1.8.1 being used.
  - Make the version available in the image.
    -  For X.Y and X.Y.Z write the version (X.Y.Z) into /version on the image and add a label with version=X.Y.Z
  	  -  This means that the latest X.Y image shows the pinned version (X.Y.Z e.g. 1.8.1) it was based on. Via the tag X.Y.Z you can see the commit hash that triggered the built.
    -  For master write the commit hash into /version on the image and add a label with version={commit hash}
  -  Automatic releases. For x.y triggered builts (e.g. merge on 1.9) do a new github release for the pinned x.y.z (e.g. 1.9.2). 
    -  Release shows a static message (see RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md) that explains how to reach the newsfragments folder and change the branch to the tag (x.y.z) mentioned in the release. Now you can get the changelog by reading all newsfragment files in this folder. ([#1182](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1182))
- Features: Add a credential cache to speedup authentication requests. ([#1194](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1194))
- Features: Introduces postfix logging via syslog with these features:
  - stdout logging still enabled

  - optional logging to file via POSTFIX_LOG_FILE env variable
  To use logging to file configure in mailu.env
  - ``POSTFIX_LOG_FILE``: The file to log the mail log to ([#1441](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1441))

- Features: Remove Mailu PostgreSQL. It is fully deprecated. No images will be built anymore and it cannot be selected in the setup utility.
  The roundcube database flavour (e.g. PostgreSQL or SQLite) can now be selected indepently of the Mailu (Admin) database flavour.
  Fix bug #1838. ([#2069](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2069))
- Bugfixes: RELAYNETS should be a comma separated list of networks ([#360](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/360))
- Bugfixes: Fix rate-limiting on /webdav/ ([#1194](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1194))
- Bugfixes: Fixed fetchmail losing track of fetched emails upon container recreation. 
  The relevant fetchmail files are now retained in the /data folder (in the fetchmail image).
  See the docker-compose.yml file for the relevant volume mapping.
  If you already had your own mapping, you must double check the volume mapping and take action. ([#1223](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1223))
- Bugfixes: Ensure that the podop socket is always owned by the postfix user (wasn't the case when build using non-standard base images... typically for arm64) ([#1294](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1294))

- Bugfixes: Alpine has removed support for btree and hash in postfix... please use lmdb instead ([#1917](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1917))
- Bugfixes: Webmail and Radicale (webdav) were not useable with domains with special characters such as umlauts.
  Webmail and radicale now use punycode for logging in.
  Punycode was not used in the HTTP headers. This resulted in illegal non-ASCII HTTP headers. ([#1952](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1952))
- Bugfixes: Ensure that we do not trust the source-ip address set in headers if REAL_IP_HEADER isn't set. If you are using Mailu behind a reverse proxy, please ensure that you do read the documentation. ([#1960](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1960))
- Bugfixes: Reverse proxy documentation has been updated to reflect new security hardening from PR#1959.
  If you do not set the configuration parameters in Mailu what reverse proxy header to trust,
  then Mailu will not have access to the real ip address of the connecting client.
  This means that rate limiting will not properly work. You can also not use fail2ban. 
  It is very important to configure this when using a reverse proxy. ([#1962](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1962))
- Bugfixes: Fixed roundcube sso login not working. ([#1990](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1990))

- Bugfixes: Fix build dependencies postfix-mta-sts-resolver. ([#2106](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2106))
- Improved Documentation: Document hardware requirements when using clamav. 
  Clamav requires **at least** 2GB of memory.
  This 2Gb does not entail any other software running on the box.
  So in total you require at least 3GB of memory and 1GB swap when antivirus is enabled. ([#470](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/470))
- Improved Documentation: Added documentation for how to switch the database back-end used by Mailu.
  Added documentation for migrating from the deprecated Mailu PostgreSQL image to a different PostgreSQL database. ([#1037](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1037))

v1.7.0 - 2019-08-22
-------------------

Upgrade should run fine as long as you generate a new compose or stack
configuration and upgrade your mailu.env.

If you run the PostgreSQL server, the database was upgrade, so you will need to
dump the database before upgrading and load the dump after the upgrade is
